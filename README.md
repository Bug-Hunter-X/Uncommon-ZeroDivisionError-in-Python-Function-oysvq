# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Python
This example highlights a subtle error that can lead to a `ZeroDivisionError` in Python, despite the logic appearing correct at first glance.
The function `function_with_uncommon_error` intends to handle different cases of input `x`. However, in this specific scenario, the division is performed without accounting for the possibility of a negative input that leads to zero when computing the denominator. 
The solution provides a robust way to handle the negative input, thereby preventing the `ZeroDivisionError`.
